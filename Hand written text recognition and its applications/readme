    -tkinter
    *Note :- application named "IP Webcam" required on android device to use its camera.
About project:-
  This is a basic project on handwritten digits recognition using MNIST dataset and Convolution model
  The convolution model comprises of 2 convolution layer, 1 max pooling , 1 Flattern and 2 dense layer
  The first application is that it will recognize the image in the path given in the "image.py"
  The second application is that it will get the input of the video from the camera of android camera using a mobile application.
  The third application is exicuted with help of Tkinter. A Track pad window is made where the digit can be drawn using keyboard and a mouse.
  All the application can be navigated using a single Tikinter window which pops up by running "main.py"
How to run the project:-
    -Install the Packages Required 
    -Clone the "Hand written text recognition and its applications" floder
    -Run the file "model.py"
    -Install the "IPwebcam" application in your android device.
    -Take down the ip address and wrtie it insted of "ipaddress" in 6th line of "image_live.py"
